* INTRODUCTION
This is a test project to be used as part of hands-on training on
Git.

This repo contains a collections of small programs to convert numbers
from one format to another.

* IMPROVEMENTS
- Write a Makefile to build executables for each program and put them
  into a separate folder
- Make the program run in a loop. Pressing 'q' should end the program
- Make the program accept multiple input numbers separated by comma
- [bug] dec_to_roman.cpp prints DCCCC for 900 instead of CM
- [bug] dec_to_hex.cpp does not handle 0 or negative numbers
